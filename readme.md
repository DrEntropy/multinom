# Multinomial Regression with PyMC

This repository is a small project designed to explore multinomial regression using [PyMC](https://www.pymc.io/), a probabilistic programming library for Bayesian modeling.

## Overview

Multinomial regression is a statistical technique used to model outcomes with more than two categories. This repository demonstrates how to implement and analyze multinomial regression models using PyMC.
 

## Requirements

see yaml file.
